# PandemicDatingSim
Our game is meant to be a dating sim/visual novel taking place during a pandemic.

Controls:
You can get to the end of the current sentence being written by pressing enter. 
You left click the buttons when they come up to make a selection.
There's a current bug where pressing enter can auto click a button, but the game should still function.
During the minigame you should use WASD to move the white circle around. 
The goal is to avoid touching the red circles. If you get hit you still must wait for the 30 seconds to run out.


The game has a ton of filler text due to this being a prototype and the main implementations taking most of the time to get fully working.
There's a random scene that will start the minigame, so just keep playing through until you trigger it.
The outcome of the minigame and the romance stat aren't really used for anything but would be used for further story branches and scoring if the project was continued.

Art was custom made.

Hope you like the idea of our game :)
